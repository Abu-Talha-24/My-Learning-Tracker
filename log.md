Continued working on the **Udacity Google Scholarship** course: mainly [arrays](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/arrays.js) and [objects](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/objects.js).

Since this is not the first time I'm learning some of these concepts I feel I am understanding them on a deeper level, and I feel good about being able to solve most of the exercises with little or no help. Most importantly I feel I can visualise the solution and understand it.<br>
I was especially amazed to discover how you can create a `method()` inside of an object and call it.

Worked on the **JavaScript** section in the **Udacity Google Scholarship** course: [Functions](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/functions.js "Functions practice document") and arrays.<br>
Managed to solve most of the problems without help. Not easy, but **#OperationJavaScript** is on ðŸ’ª.

Started on the first two screen casts of **Scrimba's Learn CSS Grid** course. I'm amazed by the platform where you can edit the code right in the screen!

All in all a **good** all-day session.

Spent the last few weeks working on the Udacity's Google Challenge Scholarship course. Then built a [full tutorial](https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project) for begginers to make their first contribution on GitHub. Spent a good amount of time improving it and learning more markdown in the process and dealing with the PRs I'm getting (17 contributions so far). Also added a custom JS feature to the [contribution page](https://syknapse.github.io/Contribute-To-This-Project/) that counts the number of contributions and displays the number in a counter with a count up style.
