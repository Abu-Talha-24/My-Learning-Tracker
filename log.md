## 2 Jan 18

Back from a day off. Finished the Udacity course content and I'm no won the final project; Pixel Art Maker. Everything is setup and ready to go tomorrow. I'm really looking forward to doing it and finishing the course completely before moving on to more in depth JavaScript for my #OperationJavaScript objective.

Practiced jQuery DOM manipulation and event listeners and found it useful.
Read the Udacity style guides for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git which gave me a good insight on clean code writing.

read [How I got to 200 productive hours a month](https://qotoqot.com/blog/improving-focus/) and [The Reddit post that initiated the "No Zero Days" idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) Which I though resonated with the way I have been working on coding for the past few months, and more generally over the last few years of changing negative habits and building positive ones.

Finished the introduction to Javascript on my Udacity course with more work on objects. And started the jQuery section. Advancing at a good pace. Participation in the forum is bringing in a wider understanding of the subjects.<br>
Exercises like this one in the image have really made me understand methods and how versatile objects can be.

**That's a wrap 2017. See you in 2018!**

Continued working on the **Udacity Google Scholarship** course: mainly [arrays](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/arrays.js) and [objects](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/objects.js).

Since this is not the first time I'm learning some of these concepts I feel I am understanding them on a deeper level, and I feel good about being able to solve most of the exercises with little or no help. Most importantly I feel I can visualise the solution and understand it.<br>
I was especially amazed to discover how you can create a `method()` inside of an object and call it.

Worked on the **JavaScript** section in the **Udacity Google Scholarship** course: [Functions](https://github.com/Syknapse/Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Front-End-Web-Dev/blob/master/short-exercises/functions.js "Functions practice document") and arrays.<br>
Managed to solve most of the problems without help. Not easy, but **#OperationJavaScript** is on ðŸ’ª.

Started on the first two screen casts of **Scrimba's Learn CSS Grid** course. I'm amazed by the platform where you can edit the code right in the screen!

All in all a **good** all-day session.

## 24 Dec 17

Spent the last few weeks working on the Udacity's Google Challenge Scholarship course. Then built a [full tutorial](https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project) for begginers to make their first contribution on GitHub. Spent a good amount of time improving it and learning more markdown in the process and dealing with the PRs I'm getting (17 contributions so far). Also added a custom JS feature to the [contribution page](https://syknapse.github.io/Contribute-To-This-Project/) that counts the number of contributions and displays the number in a counter with a count up style.
